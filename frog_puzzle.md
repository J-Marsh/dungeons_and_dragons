**Puzzle Name:** Dance of the Festival Frogs

*Description:*  
Upon entering the domed, brightly painted chamber, the party is greeted by the lively chirps and croaks of four plump frogs, each perched atop a colored pedestal: emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red, and golden yellow. The walls are adorned with faded murals depicting joyous festival goers performing different celebratory gestures — clapping, whistling, stamping, waving — among a swirl of dancing frogs. A double stone door on the far side is sealed shut, with four colored gemstones embedded above it.

**Puzzle Overview / Setup:**  
To open the exit, players must perform the correct sequence of gestures to persuade the magical, color-coded frogs to “dance” in turn. The chamber draws inspiration from ancient festival games where humans and enchanted frogs would celebrate together, so the solution involves deducing which gesture commands each frog and the correct performance order, guided by pictograms and magical feedback.

**Features of the Area:**  
- Four squat stone pedestals, each topped with a vibrantly colored frog (green, blue, red, yellow).
- A large stone double-door marked with four inset gemstones matching the frog colors, arranged in a particular sequence (e.g., red, yellow, green, blue).
- Faded murals along the walls, depicting color-coded frogs and festival participants performing gestures (clap, whistle, stomp, wave) near matching colored frogs.
- Each frog’s pedestal features a small pictogram (randomized per reset; DM chart provided for reference; see below).
- The chamber is suffused with cheerful ambient illusion-music and magical lighting.
- No apparent traps or hazards at first glance.

**Clues:**  
- Any character inspecting the murals or pedestals notices the pictograms: a clear gesture illustrated next to each colored frog. (No check required — information is visible.)
- The gemstones above the door show the required sequence of frog colors.
- *Performance, Animal Handling,* or *Arcana* checks (DC 12) allow characters to interpret the murals more rapidly, or notice subtle cues from each frog: for example, the blue frog inflates its throat when a whistle is heard.
- If a player makes a gesture at a frog and it is the correct gesture but out of sequence, the frog does a short dance and croaks, then settles down — confirming the association.
- If the correct gesture is performed at the correct frog in the right sequence, the frog launches into an enthusiastic dance, musical lights swirl, and the corresponding gemstone above the door flares.
- Incorrect gestures at any frog lead to silly frog reactions: annoyed ribbits, backward hops, or color flashes.

**Puzzle Mechanics / Rules:**  
- At the start of each attempt (or when the puzzle is reset), the DM randomizes the gesture association for each frog (see the chart below, or roll d4 for each frog color). Place the linked pictogram visibly on the pedestal and in the mural.
- Players must perform the gestures at the correct frog pedestals, *in the order shown by the color sequence above the door* (e.g., red, yellow, green, blue).
- Gestures: Clapping, Whistling, Stomping, Waving.
- Any player can attempt a gesture at any frog. Gestures can be performed one at a time or by multiple party members working together.
- Performing the correct gesture at a frog at the wrong time yields a distinctive but less elaborate frog dance (confirming color-gesture pairings but not progressing sequence).
- Performing the incorrect gesture at a frog yields a playful or silly response, but does not progress the puzzle.
- When all four frogs have “danced” in the correct order and with the correct gesture, the gemstones above the door pulse, the door clicks, and opens.

*Sample DM Randomization Table:*
| Frog Color | Gesture (DM randomly assigns) | Pictogram/Mural Clue |
|:----------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Green      | __________                   | __________           |
| Blue       | __________                   | __________           |
| Red        | __________                   | __________           |
| Yellow     | __________                   | __________           |

DM may use d4: 1=Clap, 2=Whistle, 3=Stomp, 4=Wave. Assign and note pictogram and mural art accordingly each time.

**Solution:**  
- To solve the puzzle, perform the gesture matching each frog’s pictogram at its pedestal, in the colored order shown above the door (e.g., if red is first, yellow second, green third, blue fourth).
- If players correctly read the pictograms/murals, observe the frogs’ reactions, or succeed on skill checks, the associations and order become clear.

**Failure / Consequences:**  
- Incorrect gestures, or gestures made out of sequence, result in whimsical frog antics: color flashes, silly dances, mock confusion, or musical “raspberries.” No damage or lasting penalty is incurred — the puzzle is meant to encourage fun and exploration.
- After a failed sequence attempt (all four gestures tried in order), the frogs return to their original positions; players can try again immediately.
- If players persist in incorrect sequences, the DM may allow a friendly fey or spectral festival goer to offer an additional hint (at your discretion).

**Rewards / Outcome:**  
- Solving the puzzle opens the sealed doors, allowing passage onward. A gleaming festival mask (minor magical trinket) nestles by the open door as an optional bonus.
- Each player who contributed meaningfully (through gestures, clues, or clever strategy) may earn 25 XP (or equivalent party XP).
- Story progression and a sense of whimsical accomplishment are primary prizes.
